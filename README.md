# ExicogaServer
ExicogaServer is a fork of PocketMine-MP. The goal is to make a way to create a network of servers that redirect players to each other. This can be useful to decrease the load on individual servers, make sure players are connected to servers with the lowest ping, or to simply have different servers for each game mode/minigame.
